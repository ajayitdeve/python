        "*   **Data Loading Failure**: The initial attempt to load the SCADA timeseries data from `scada_timeseries.csv` resulted in a `FileNotFoundError`, preventing the use of real data.\n",
        "*   **Dummy Data for Preprocessing**: Due to the data loading issue, a dummy DataFrame of shape (100, 5) was generated to allow the preprocessing steps to proceed. This dummy data was then scaled using `MinMaxScaler`.\n",
        "*   **LSTM Sequence Creation**: A `sequence_length` of 30 was defined, and the scaled dummy data was transformed into LSTM input sequences (`X_train`) with a shape of (70, 30, 5).\n",
        "*   **Model Architecture and Training**: An LSTM-based autoencoder model was successfully constructed and compiled. It had 200,837 trainable parameters and was trained for 50 epochs using `mae` loss. The training completed with a final validation loss (`val_loss`) of approximately 0.2375.\n",
        "*   **Anomaly Detection**:\n",
        "    *   The trained model predicted reconstructions, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) was used to calculate reconstruction errors for 70 sequences. The first five errors were `[0.2704, 0.2702, 0.2671, 0.2568, 0.2514]`.\n",
        "    *   An anomaly threshold was set at the 99th percentile of these errors, which was calculated to be 0.2857.\n",
        "    *   Based on this threshold, **one anomaly** was detected at sequence index 41.\n",
        "*   **Anomaly Visualization**: A plot successfully visualized the reconstruction errors, the calculated anomaly threshold, and highlighted the single detected anomalous point, providing a clear representation of the anomaly.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Address Data Availability**: The most critical next step is to ensure the correct `scada_timeseries.csv` file is available at the specified path. The entire analysis was performed on dummy data, which limits the real-world applicability of the findings.\n",
        "*   **Interpret Anomaly in Context**: Once real data is used and anomalies are detected, further investigation into the specific time window or sensor readings associated with the anomalous sequence (e.g., index 41) would be necessary to understand the root cause or nature of the operational deviation.\n"
